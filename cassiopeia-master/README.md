# Cassiopeia

A Python adaptation of the Riot Games LoL API (https://developer.riotgames.com/).

Cassiopeia is the sister library to [Orianna](https://github.com/robrua/Orianna) (Java). It's been designed with usability in mind - making sure all the bookkeeping is done right so you can focus on getting the data you need and building your application. There's two main entry points - riotapi and baseriotapi. The former handles a ton of stuff behind the scenes to make your development experience awesome, while the latter allows you fine-grained control by exposing the Riot API exactly as the website's documentation specifies.

## Usage

Here's an example of a basic use of the API. The full documentation can be found at http://cassiopeia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.

```python
import random

from cassiopeia import riotapi

riotapi.set_region("NA")
riotapi.set_api_key("YOUR-API-KEY-HERE")

summoner = riotapi.get_summoner_by_name("FatalElement")
print("{name} is a level {level} summoner on the NA server.".format(name=summoner.name, level=summoner.level))

champions = riotapi.get_champions()
random_champion = random.choice(champions)
print("He enjoys playing LoL on all different champions, like {name}.".format(name=random_champion.name))

challenger_league = riotapi.get_challenger()
best_na = challenger_league[0].summoner
print("He's much better at writing Python code than he is at LoL. He'll never be as good as {name}.".format(name=best_na.name))
```
